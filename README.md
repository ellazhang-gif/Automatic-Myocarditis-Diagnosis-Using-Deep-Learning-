# Automatic Diagnosis of Myocarditis in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images Using Deep Learning Models
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a popular technique for the diagnosis of myocarditis. However, there are some challenges for specialist physicians to identify myocarditis with CMR due to factors such as low contrast, various noises, and invisible mass or lesion in the images. On one hand, deep learning models requires a large amount of data to achieve good results, but expert manually-annotated medical images are expensive to acquire. On the other hand, deep learning pre-trained models suffer from domain discrepancy and overfitting when trained on a small-sized dataset. 

# Preface
Medical imaging problems are never in short supply in the field of machine learning. They are particularly meaningful because the solutions obtained could make a contribution to improving human health and saving lives. Machine learning techniques can be very helpful for this type of problems. In this work, we choose myocarditis and Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images as the target disease and images type. This idea is inspired by the passion and dedication of the authors to apply skills learnt from Data Science major to healthcare field, as well as by the personal experience of one author, which is especially meaningful to her. 
        \newline
        The target audience is designed to be our fellow students, professors and scholars from the field of data science, computer science and/or medicine and health science, or general professionals who have a background in these mentioned and relevant areas. In this work, we explore deep learning models that have not been applied in the diagnosis of myocarditis with CMR images before according to existing publications, and the results may give implications for methods chosen in future practice.
